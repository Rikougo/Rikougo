# Welcome to my page

Hey, I am Samuel "Elye" Helye, but yeah my github first nickname is Rikougo, the first thing you should know about me is that I used to have a lot of different nickname (and you'll know only some of them for the better...). 
Almost graduated (at my last year !) in Computer Science specialized on Image processing and 3D programing. I love software engineering, taking hours to plan a perfect software architecture to be flexible and robust. And I also deeply love gameplay programing, so I use to work on games of my own or personal game engine on my free time. 

On a side note I also like drawing, powerlifting and metal music.
